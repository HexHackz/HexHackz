### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

###
- Now I just need to find the time (finally) to sit and learn some basic coding,this is just to expand my knowledge, and see what I can achieve.
-   
- My day job is fitting whirlpool & air spa systems to domestic bathtubs, as far from this as it get's I suppose. :smiley:
- 
- ðŸ’¬ Heck, I'm an approachable guy, so if any of you good people on here take the time to glance at this readme and you have a jetted tub (Jacuzzi) and you have an issue with it, or general queries about these systems, feel free to drop me a message and I'll help as much as I can.ðŸ’¬ 
- ðŸ“« And no, I'm not saying that for any type of gains for myself. As with anything, searching online for answers as I'll be doing to find solutions for myself
- here, any articles or guides I come across might well have been written or contributed, by you. I guess just my way of showing appreciation for expertise that
- will help me with any coding attempts, I'll happily share the knowledge of nearly 30 years in my chosen profession, as relatively obscure as it is.
